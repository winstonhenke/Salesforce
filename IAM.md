- Control Who Sees What
  - Although it’s easy to confuse `permission sets` and `profiles` with `roles`, they control two different things.
  - `Permission sets` and `profiles` control a user’s **object and field access permissions**.
  - `Roles` primarily control a user’s **record-level access** through role hierarchy and sharing rules.
