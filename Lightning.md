# Lightning Components

Lightning components: Client side UI rendering

- Primarily used in Lightning Experience but can also be used in Salesforce Classic [using Visualforce pages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/components_visualforce.htm)
- You can build Lightning components using two programming models
  - Lightning Web Components model (LWC)
  - The original Aura Components model
- A UI development framework similar to AngularJS or React for desktop and mobile
- Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page
- Lightning web components (LWC)
  - The newer component model
  - Custom HTML elements built using HTML and modern JavaScript
  - Lightning web components inherit global HTML attributes and events
  - LWC basically takes the form through native web standards that are in the browser. It means that no added abstraction layer like Aura Framework or any other framework, we only need standard JavaScript to develop.
- Aura Components
  - The older component model, also known as lightning components
  - Relies less on open standards and more proprietary abstractions to do the same actions LWC can do with native JavaScript/HTML
